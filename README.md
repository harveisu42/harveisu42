-👋 Hi, I’m- @harveisu42
👀 I’m interested in s/w design, integration and test, testing out new s/w.<!---
My background is in electronic design, system engineering,physics,mathematics,
sci-fi,s/w development, configuration management, ....
I'm just a science and technology geek.

I like to conduct private studies, analysis, create customized prorocols,etc.
optimized metrics for processes and methods.
It seems like the exercize is like peeling an onion- most of the time it seems 
like I never get anywhere. Maybe these apps like asana and/or workona will
help solve these issues.
